--What aspects of the data would you want to discuss with a client? 

--Interesting thing in data is that the cancellations are happening by only our repeat customers. We also tend to receive lesser orders from repeat customers

--Conclusion: This could mean we have low stickiness with the customers. We should analyze our NPS/Other metric to see why this is happening.


--Knowing more business context here would be helpful to make more recommendations
